# DX11 Wind Simulation Prototype

A wind simulation inspired from God of War wind and Ghost of Tsushima wind and grass talks.

The code is not awesome. It is for prototyping some techniques and learning DX11.
I am open to feedback to improve the visuals or performance.

Read todo.txt for a glimpse of my plans about this project.
