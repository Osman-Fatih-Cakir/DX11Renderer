TASKS:
[ ] wind simulation
	[+] calculate 2D noise texture (or just steal a texture from internet :) )
	[+] using noise texture, apply translating of the grasses, care stretching as in the talk
	[+] omni-directional wind around mouse pos
	[+] radius around the mouse pos
	[ ] stretch avoid calculation makes the grasses thinner, allow a bit of stretching based on the
		speed and etc.
	[+] Q for switch between omni and directional
	[ ] Simulate wind
		[+] use two textures, calculate on one texture while giving the other texture to render
		[+] use 2D textures and apply the same calculations to that, use the texture for rendering
			- after this step, everything should look the same
		[+] use 3D textures instead of 2D textures
			- after this step, everything should look the seamlessly
		[ ] scratch out the ping pong textures
		[ ] make radius change with key input
	[ ] make spiral wind
	[ ] make wind texture format rgb32f instead of rgba32f. See why u cant if u cant.
	[ ] what is that hwnd doing in renderPass classes init function argument?!
	[ ] use squared distance instead of distance for distance calculation in shader
	[ ] in tech talk, they make the wind direction by translating around the noise texture in different ways.
		I calculate a direction and apply it which is not a great idea since the normalized vector y is defined by a constant.
		So make it work.
	[ ] Create the best visual and show the outputs (make a Youtube video and link it in Readme)
[ ] Next
	- make the bending grasses with bezier curves and wind as Ghost of Tsushima grass talk
	- terrain generation and grass on top of it
	- sky rendering and lighting

- a little wind effect might be great (white lines according to the wind direction and position)
- what else? I want to say "I have done these based on these talks or articles"

BUGS:
[ ] wind noise cuts after some time (the noise should work seamlessly)
[ ] when vsync is active, input is lagging
[ ] remove the old pipeline
