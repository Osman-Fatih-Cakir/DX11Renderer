Near Tasks:
[ ] free camera
[ ] create functions for transformation operations and use them for camera and mesh
[ ] create an mvp matrix and sent it instead of sending projection, world, view seperately
[ ] remove transpose mvp matrices on cpu (ForwardLightingRenderPass.cpp)

Next Tasks:
[ ] finish the tutorial
[ ] instanced rendering (grass rendering would be great)
[ ] ambient occlusion (render to texture)
	- I think grass rendering would benefit more from ambent occlusion than shadows.
	but if it is not enough, go for shadows.
	[ ] ? Shadows
[ ] compute shaders
	- ? wind simulation
	- ? cloud rendering
	- what else?
[ ] ? terrain rendering
