Next Tasks: (all tasks are 1 day tasks)
[+] finish the tutorial
[ ] instanced rendering (grass rendering would be great)
	 [+] render a grass (long pyramid)
	 [+] import and render a grass
	 [+] check memory leaks
	 [ ] fix camera movements
	 [ ] render grasses with instanciating
	 	[ ] sample lardan instancinge bak, matrixleri doldurup instancdeid yollayÄ±p yapacan 
	 [ ] create a tile with grasses
	 [ ] create a terrain using tiles
	 [ ] frustum culling for tiles
	 [ ] ? occlusion culling
[ ] ambient occlusion (render to texture)
	- I think grass rendering would benefit more from ambent occlusion than shadows.
	but if it is not enough, go for shadows. It can be costly too, so may just scratch out or disable
	and find a way to show bottom of grasses darker(gradiently darker).

		lighting with forward rendering is not convinient since the scenes will consist of a lot of meshes.
		so go for deferred if u want to achieve this.	
	[ ] sun light
	[ ] shadow
