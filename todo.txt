TARGETS:
1- use omni-directional wind for wake motors (motion as wind)
2- make stormy winds if we can not achieve this yet (more aggressive looking wind)
3- spiral wind
4- write under the title "How Things Work" on Readme file
Showcase when here
5- solve wind direction for directional wind and use it for every other wind type

TASKS:
[ ] wind simulation
	[+] calculate 2D noise texture (or just steal a texture from internet :) )
	[+] using noise texture, apply translating of the grasses, care stretching as in the talk
	[+] omni-directional wind around mouse pos
	[+] radius around the mouse pos
	[ ] stretch avoid calculation makes the grasses thinner, allow a bit of stretching based on the
		speed and etc.
	[+] Q for switch between omni and directional
	[ ] Simulate wind
		[+] use two textures, calculate on one texture while giving the other texture to render
		[+] use 2D textures and apply the same calculations to that, use the texture for rendering
			- after this step, everything should look the same
		[+] use 3D textures instead of 2D textures
			- after this step, everything should look the seamlessly
		[+] scratch out the ping pong textures
		[ ] get back double buffer for wind texture
		[ ] grass movements around mouse position (like a player walking in the grasses)
		[ ] make spiral wind
	[+] use squared distance instead of distance for distance calculation in shader
	[ ] the mouse position and the center of the wind motor are slightly offsetted because of the texels of the
		wind texture (using indices for positions on compute shader causes this). Fix it
	[ ] Create the best visual and show the outputs (make a Youtube video and link it in Readme)
	[ ] different directions for directional wind
		-	in tech talk, they make the wind direction by translating around the noise texture in different ways.
		I calculate a direction and apply it which is not a great idea since the normalized vector y is defined by a constant. So make it work.
[ ] Next
	- terrain generation and grass on top of it
	- make the bending grasses with bezier curves and wind as Ghost of Tsushima grass talk
	- sky rendering and lighting

- a little wind effect might be great (white lines according to the wind direction and position)
- what else? I want to say "I have done these based on these talks or articles"

BUGS:
[ ] wind noise cuts after some time (the noise should work seamlessly)
[ ] when vsync is active, input is lagging
[ ] remove the old pipeline
