TASKS:
[ ] wind simulation
	[ ] calculate 2D noise texture with compute shader
	[ ] using noise texture, apply translating of the grasses

BUGS:
[ ] toggle move around does not work properly
[ ] when vsync is active, input is lagging

OPTIONALS:
[ ] compute shaders
	- ? wind simulation
	- ? cloud rendering
	- ? wave rendering
[ ] real-time terrain rendering
[ ] calculate MVP matrix on CPU
[ ] create a 2D terrain using tiles
[ ] frustum culling for tiles
[ ] ? occlusion culling
[ ] ambient occlusion (render to texture)
	- I think grass rendering would benefit more from ambent occlusion than shadows.
		but if it is not enough, go for shadows. It can be costly too, so may just scratch out or disable
		and find a way to show bottom of grasses darker(gradiently darker).
	- lighting with forward rendering is not convinient since the scenes will consist of a lot of meshes.
		so go for deferred if u want to achieve this.	
[ ] sun light
[ ] shadow
