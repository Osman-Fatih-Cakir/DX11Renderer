FIX:
-movement wind when going from A to B, the behind grasses direction is B to A
-since the edge of the radius wind is 0 (cz of the radius fade), how the wind is
	being left behind with a value bigger than 0?!

TARGETS:
1- use omni-directional wind for wake motors (motion as wind)
2- make stormy winds if we can not achieve this yet (more aggressive looking wind)
3- spiral wind
4- write under the title "How Things Work" on Readme file
Showcase when here

TASKS:
[+] wind simulation
	[+] calculate 2D noise texture (or just steal a texture from internet :) )
	[+] using noise texture, apply translating of the grasses, care stretching as in the talk
	[+] omni-directional wind around mouse pos
	[+] radius around the mouse pos
	[+] Q for switch between omni and directional
	[+] Simulate wind
		[+] use two textures, calculate on one texture while giving the other texture to render
		[+] use 2D textures and apply the same calculations to that, use the texture for rendering
			- after this step, everything should look the same
		[+] use 3D textures instead of 2D textures
			- after this step, everything should look the seamlessly
		[+] scratch out the ping pong textures
		[+] get back double buffer for wind texture
		[ ] in tech talk, the direction of the wind changes the sampling direction of the noise texture and
			it works. What?? How?!
		[+] movement wind with calculating the direction of the wind using deltaMouseXZ
		[+] make spiral wind
	[+] use squared distance instead of distance for distance calculation in shader
	[+] the mouse position and the center of the wind motor are slightly offsetted because of the texels of the
		wind texture (using indices for positions on compute shader causes this). Fix it

[ ] Create the best visual and show the outputs (make a Youtube video and link it in Readme)
[ ] Next
	- ?wind sim
		[ ] make a force texture
			- this texture will be filled for any new wind force applying
		[ ] calculate a wind sim using prev wind and wind force
			- tricky: what if speed of the wind is too high and we need to jump more than one texels?
	- terrain generation and grass on top of it
	- make the bending grasses with bezier curves and wind as Ghost of Tsushima grass talk
	- sky rendering and lighting

- a little wind effect might be great (white lines according to the wind direction and position)
- what else? I want to say "I have done these based on these talks or articles"

BUGS:
[ ] wind noise cuts after some time (the noise should work seamlessly)
[ ] when vsync is active, input is lagging
[ ] remove the old pipeline
