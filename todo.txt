Next Tasks: (all tasks are 1 day tasks)
[+] finish the tutorial
[ ] instanced rendering (grass rendering would be great)
	 [+] render a grass (long pyramid)
	 [ ] render grasses with instanciating
	 [ ] create a tile with grasses
	 [ ] create a terrain using tiles
	 [ ] ? frustum culling
[ ] ambient occlusion (render to texture)
	- I think grass rendering would benefit more from ambent occlusion than shadows.
	but if it is not enough, go for shadows.
	[ ] ? Shadows
[ ] compute shaders
	- ? wind simulation
	- ? cloud rendering
	- what else?
[ ] ? terrain rendering
